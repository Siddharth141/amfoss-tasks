First I downloaded the ISO file from the official website and then converted the pendrive into a bootable device using rufus.
Next I divided my hard disk into 4 parts and allocated 200 gb for ubuntu,then unlocked my boot options menu .finally installed ubuntu into the allocated drive and had done setting itup
